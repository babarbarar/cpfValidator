# cpfValidator

This is a small part of a bigger future project that will call this function to check a customer cpf before allowing payment!

This project has git ignore :)

Development obs:

- I had to run `npm install axios --save` to get module axios to work;
- To start the server I used `npx nodemon src/main.ts`;
- To check if it is working you can use `curl http://localhost:3090/checkout`;
- To run tests use `npx jest`
